                    <p>
                        I am a proactive UX designer who improves user satisfaction and loyalty by (re)designing products that meet business objectives, user needs and technical feasibility of the organisation. By conducting user research while following a user-centric, data-driven decision making process, I enhance the product-market fit from a design perspective, providing business solutions that are usable, accessible and desirable through impressive aesthetics. With a background in operational management, through my designs and attitude of collaboration, I help businesses mitigate the risk and costs of having to rebuild products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since 2022, I have been part of an IDEO award-winning game design collective called Plot Twisters. This is an ongoing volunteer project in the Tech for Good sector where I experienced design in a part-time, dynamic team context. Together we are exploring the intersection of UX in video game design with a focus on design for mental wellbeing, a long-time passion and knowledgeable area of mine since my university studies. In teams settings, my ambition is to be an ambassador for user expectations, reduce production waste and craft delightful experiences with extreme attention to detail and elevate our design outcomes to new heights of relevance and impact.
